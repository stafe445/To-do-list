* The Shopping List *
---------------------
This application provides users with 8 options that can alter their default list of food items. ["milk", "eggs", "apples", "bread"]. The 8 options are below and when one is inputted into the application, that function is completed and the user can choose to do more options. 
1. Add a item to the to-do list 
2. View the current to-do list 
3. Mark a task as completed 
4. Remove a item from the to-do list 
5. Remove all items from the to-do list
6. Sort the list alphabetically
7. Count the # of items on the To-do List

I used functions and a set of "if" statements to complete this code. In the future I look to make more options and make the code app friendly.
